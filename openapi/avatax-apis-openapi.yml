  title: AvaTax APIs
  description: "Welcome to the AvaTax API Postman Collection! \n                \nThis collection provides a REST interface to Avalara's enterprise tax service, AvaTax. You can use this collection to interact with the AvaTax APIs while building your integration. \n\nWhile using this collection, we recommend following along with our Developer Implementation Guide: https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/dev-guide/   \n\nAPI requests are grouped into folders to help you navigate through the collection easily. Each request includes a description of the operation and its associated URL, method, headers, and example request body (if applicable). \n\nThe collection uses Postman environment variables for the API base URL and credentials, making it easy to switch between the sandbox and production environments.\n\nTo get started, ensure you have the necessary credentials. Then, update the 'username' and 'password' variables in the 'Authorization' or 'Variables' section with your credentials if you prefer username and password authentication. Alternatively, you can use the 'account_id' and 'license_key' variables for authentication using an account ID and license key.\n\nWe recommend starting with the Ping API, located within the Utilities folder, to test your connectivity and ensure your authentication credentials are valid. The Ping API is a simple way to check if you can successfully communicate with AvaTax.\n\nCollection Variables:\n- Base URL: The base URL for the API. By default, it is set to the sandbox URL - https://sandbox-rest.avatax.com. \n    - Change this variable to switch between sandbox and production environments:\n        - Sandbox URL: https://sandbox-rest.avatax.com\n\t\t- Production URL: https://rest.avatax.com\n- Username: If you are using username and password authentication, enter your username for AvaTax.\n- Password: If you are using username and password authentication, enter your password for AvaTax.\n- Account ID: If you are using account ID and license key authentication, enter your AvaTax account ID. \n    - Be sure to also replace the username variable in the authorization tab with account_id.\n- License Key: If you are using account ID and license key authentication, enter your AvaTax license key.\n    - Be sure to also replace the password variable in the authorization tab with license_key.\n\nHappy testing with AvaTax APIs!"

If any certificate applies to the transaction,\r\nAvaTax will record the appropriate elements of the transaction as exempt and link it to the `certificate`.\r\n            \r\nYou can use the `$include` parameter to fetch the following additional objects for expansion:\r\n            \r\n* Certificates - Fetch a list of certificates linked to this customer.\r\n* CustomFields - Fetch a list of custom fields associated to this customer.\r\n* attributes - Retrieves all attributes applied to the customer.\r\n            \r\nBefore you can use any exemption certificates endpoints, you must set up your company for exemption certificate data storage.\r\nCompanies that do not have this storage system set up will see `CertCaptureNotConfiguredError` when they call exemption \r\ncertificate related APIs. To check if this is set up for a company, call `GetCertificateSetup`.  To request setup of exemption \r\ncertificate storage for this company, call `RequestCertificateSetup`.\n\n### Security Policies\n\n* This API requires one of the following user roles: AccountAdmin, AccountOperator, AccountUser, BatchServiceAdmin, CompanyAdmin, CompanyUser, CSPTester, SSTAdmin, TechnicalSupportAdmin, TechnicalSupportUser.\n* This API depends on the following active services:*Required* (all):  AvaTaxPro.\n"

To set a field's value to null,\r\nyou may either set its value to null or omit that field from the object you post.\r\n            \r\nThe tax code takes precedence over the tax code id if both are provided.\n\n### Security Policies\n\n* This API requires one of the following user roles: AccountAdmin, BatchServiceAdmin, CompanyAdmin, CSPTester, SSTAdmin, TechnicalSupportAdmin.\n"

For geocode-based transactions, please provide the geocode\r\ninformation in the fields `latitude` and `longitude`.  If either `latitude` or `longitude` or both are null, the transaction will be calculated\r\nusing the best available address location information.\r\n            \r\nYou may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:\r\n            \r\n* Lines\r\n* Details (implies lines)\r\n* Summary (implies details)\r\n* Addresses\r\n* SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)\r\n* LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)\r\n* ForceTimeout - Simulates a timeout.  This adds a 30 second delay and error to your API call.  This can be used to test your code to ensure it can respond correctly in the case of a dropped connection.\r\n            \r\nIf you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.\r\n            \r\nNOTE: If your companyCode or transactionCode contains any of these characters /, +, ? or a space please use the following encoding before making a request:\r\n* Replace '/' with '\\_-ava2f-\\_'  For example: document/Code becomes document_-ava2f-_Code\r\n* Replace '+' with '\\_-ava2b-\\_'  For example: document+Code becomes document_-ava2b-_Code\r\n* Replace '?' with '\\_-ava3f-\\_'  For example: document?Code becomes document_-ava3f-_Code\r\n* Replace '%' with '\\_-ava25-\\_'  For example: document%Code becomes document_-ava25-_Code\r\n* Replace '#' with '\\_-ava23-\\_'  For example: document#Code becomes document_-ava23-_Code\r\n* Replace ' ' with '%20'  For example: document Code becomes document%20Code\n\n### Security Policies\n\n* This API requires one of the following user roles: AccountAdmin, AccountOperator, AccountUser, BatchServiceAdmin, CompanyAdmin, CompanyUser, CSPTester, SSTAdmin, TechnicalSupportAdmin, TechnicalSupportUser.\n* This API depends on the following active services:*Required* (all):  AvaTaxPro.\n"

You can choose to create a full or partial refund, and\r\nspecify individual line items from the original sale for refund.\r\n            \r\nThe `RefundTransaction` API ensures that the tax amount you refund to the customer exactly matches the tax that\r\nwas calculated during the original transaction, regardless of any changes to your company's configuration, rules,\r\nnexus, or any other setting.\r\n            \r\nThis API is intended to be a shortcut to allow you to quickly and accurately generate a refund for the following\r\ncommon refund scenarios:\r\n            \r\n* A full refund of a previous sale\r\n* Refunding the tax that was charged on a previous sale, when the customer provides an exemption certificate after the purchase\r\n* Refunding one or more items (lines) from a previous sale\r\n* Granting a customer a percentage refund of a previous sale\r\n            \r\nFor more complex scenarios than the ones above, please use `CreateTransaction` with document type `ReturnInvoice` to\r\ncreate a custom refund transaction.\r\n            \r\nYou may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:\r\n            \r\n* Lines\r\n* Details (implies lines)\r\n* AccountPayableSalesTaxDetails (implies lines - only for Account Payable transaction)\r\n* Summary (implies details)\r\n* Addresses\r\n* SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)\r\n* LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)\r\n* TaxDetailsByTaxType - Includes the aggregated tax, exempt tax, taxable and non-taxable for each tax type returned in the transaction summary.\r\nIf you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.\r\n            \r\nNOTE: If your companyCode or transactionCode contains any of these characters /, +, ? or a space please use the following encoding before making a request:\r\n* Replace '/' with '\\_-ava2f-\\_'  For example: document/Code becomes document_-ava2f-_Code\r\n* Replace '+' with '\\_-ava2b-\\_'  For example: document+Code becomes document_-ava2b-_Code\r\n* Replace '?' with '\\_-ava3f-\\_'  For example: document?Code becomes document_-ava3f-_Code\r\n* Replace '%' with '\\_-ava25-\\_'  For example: document%Code becomes document_-ava25-_Code\r\n* Replace '#' with '\\_-ava23-\\_'  For example: document#Code becomes document_-ava23-_Code\r\n* Replace ' ' with '%20'  For example: document Code becomes document%20Code\n\n### Security Policies\n\n* This API requires one of the following user roles: AccountAdmin, AccountOperator, AccountUser, BatchServiceAdmin, CompanyAdmin, CompanyUser, CSPTester, SSTAdmin, TechnicalSupportAdmin, TechnicalSupportUser.\n* This API depends on the following active services:*Required* (all):  AvaTaxPro, BasicReturns.\n"
